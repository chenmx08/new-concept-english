# One good turn  deserves another

------

I  was  having dinner  at  a restaurant when Tony Steele came in. Tony worked  in a lawyer's office years ago. but he is now working at a bank. 

He gets a good salary. but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back . Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table .

He has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating . I asked him to lend me twenty pounds 

To my surprise ,he gave me the money immediately , ‘ I have never borrowed any money from you ' Tony said ' so now you can pay for my dinner ’

        当我正在饭馆吃饭的时候 Tony Steele 走了进来。Tony 在一家律师事务所工作很多年，现在他刚刚跳槽到银行工作。他的收入很不错。但是他经常向朋友借钱但是从来不还。Tony 看到我了，向我走了，并且坐到我这桌。他从来没有向我借过钱。当他吃饭的时候我开口向他借了20英镑。令我惊讶的是，他居然马上就借给我了，并且说道，‘我从来都没有向你借过钱，这段饭是不是该你请’
