# He  often does this !

------

after I  had lunch  at a village pub, I looked for my bag 

I  had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there 

As I was looking for it , the landlord came in

​	Did you have a good meal ? he asked 

​	yes , thank you , I  answered , but I can't pay the bill , I haven't got my bag 

The landlord smiled and immediately went out . 

In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me 

​	I'm very sorry , he said , My dog had taken it into the garden He often does this

	我在小镇酒吧吃完中饭之后，一直在找我的包。我把包放在门边的椅子上，但是现在它不在那边了。正当我在寻找我的包的时候，酒吧老板进来了，问我吃的怎么样？我回答到，挺好的，谢谢，但是我付不了钱，因为我找不到我的包了
    老板笑道，立马跑到外面。几分钟后他带着我的包回来了，他把包还给了我，非常抱歉，他说道，我的狗把你的包叼走了，它经常这么干。
