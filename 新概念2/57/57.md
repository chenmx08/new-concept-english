# Can I help you , madam 

------

A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop . Though she hesitated for a moment ,she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window . 

The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed .

Glancing at her scornfully , he told her that the dress was sold . 

The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day 

she returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat ,with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other .

After seeking out the rude assistant , she asked for the same dress .Not realizing who she was , the assistant was eager to server her this time . 

With great difficulty , he climbed into the shop window to get the dress . As soon as she saw it , the woman said she did not like it 

She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first asked for
