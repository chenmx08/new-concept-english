# Always young

------

My aunt Jennifer is an actress ， she  must be  at least thirty-five years old 

In spite of this , she often appears on  the stage as a young girl . Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon

This time ， she will  be a girl of seventeen ， In the play ， she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings ，

Last year in another play ， she had to wear short socks and a bright ， orange-coloured dress ， 

If  anyone ever asks her how old she is， she always answers， Darling，it must be terrible to be grown up
