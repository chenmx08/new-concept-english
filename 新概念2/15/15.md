# Good news 

------

The secretary told me that Mr.Harmsworth would see me。 I felt  very nervous when I went into his office。 

He did not look up from his desk when I entered。After I had sat down ， he said that business was very bad。He told me that firm could not afford to pay such large salaries。 Twenty people had already left。I knew that my turn had come 。

​	‘Mr.Harmsworth ’ I said in a weak voice 

​	’Don't interrupt ‘ he said

​	Then he smiled  and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year

As soon as he had got into the car ， I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language。 Apart  from a few words， I  do not know any French at all。Neither of us spoke during the journey ， I had nearly reached the town ， when the young man suddenly said ， very slowly， ‘Do you speak English， As I soon learnt ， he was English himself ‘

        秘书通知我 Harmsworth 先生想要见我，当我进他办公室的时候我感到非常紧张。他没有抬头看我当我进去的时候。在我坐下之后，他说今年的生意非常难做，公司负担不起巨大的薪水支出，已经有20名员工已经离职了。我知道现在轮到我了。
        harmsworth 先生，我用非常轻的声音说道。
        不要打断我，他说
        然后他冲我微笑并且说道，你的年薪会提高一千英镑
