# Faster than sound 

------

Once a year ,a race is held for old cars . A lot of cars entered for this race last year and there was a great deal of excitement just before it began .

One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost .

The most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels . 

Built in 1885 , it was the oldest car taking part . After a great many loud explosions , the race began .

Many of the cars broke down on the course and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them !

A few cars , however , completed the race .

The winning car reached a speed of forty miles an hour ---much faster than any of its rivals .

It sped downhill at the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it .

The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure .

It was very different from modern car races but on less exciting

        一年一度的老式赛车比赛开始了，去年这个时候有很多汽车参与了这个比赛，在开始之前大家都兴奋起来了
        其中最好看的汽车是一款名为 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost的车。
        最不同寻常的车是 Benz 它只有三个轮子。生产于1885年，是参赛汽车中最古老的款式。在大量大声呼喊之后，比赛开始了。很多汽车直接抛锚。有些驾驶员在车底的时候比在车里面的时间还要多。
        少部分汽车最终完成了比赛。获胜的汽车它的最高时速达到了40英里每小时。比其他参赛选手的汽车都快了不少。它在比赛最后赛段尝试减速并且它的驾驶员在试着停下它的时候面临很多困难。比赛给每一个人都带来了欢乐。这与现代的赛车比赛很不同，但是一样非常的令人激动
