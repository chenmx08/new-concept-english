# Not a gold mine 

------

Dream of finding lost treasure almost came true recently .

A new machine called 'The Revealer ' has been invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground 

The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where --- it is said -- pirates used to hide gold .

The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it 

Armed with the new machine , a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure 

The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground .

Very excited , the party dug a hole two feet deep 

They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless 

The party then searched the whole cave throughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk . **In spite of this** , many people are confident that 'The Revealer 'may reveal something of value fairly soon

        最近梦想找到失落的宝藏的愿望几乎快要实现了，一种名叫The Revealer的新探索机器被发明出来，用来发现埋在地下的黄金
        这个机器放置在靠近海岸的洞穴里面，因为这里面传说可能是海盗们藏匿黄金的地方。海盗们经常把黄金埋在洞穴里面却忘记回收。
        在新机器的帮助下，一只搜索队进入洞穴希望在里面找到财宝。探索队的领队非常兴奋，当机器显示下方有黄金时
        探索队非常兴奋的向下挖了两只脚那么深，最终只找到了一个几乎毫无价值的小金币
        之后探索队非常仔细的检查了整个洞穴，但是什么都没有发现除了空空的行李箱。
        尽管如此，很多人们相信名为 The Revealer的机器能帮助寻找有价值的东西
