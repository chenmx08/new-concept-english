# Everything except the weather 

------

My old friend ,Harrison ,had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England .

He had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country .He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live there 

Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather ,for even though it was still summer ,it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold 

After so many years of sunshine ,Harrison got a shock ,it was acted as if he had never lived in England before .

In the end ,it was more than he could bear .He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country 

The  dream he had had for so many years ended there . Harrison had thought of everything except the weather

       我的老朋友 Harrison 在地中海生活了很多年直到他回到英国之前。他曾经经常梦想着在退休之后能够回到英国并且计划定居在乡间。他一回来就立刻买了一幢房子开始居住在这里。
        几乎立刻他就开始抱怨天气，尽管现在时夏天，但是雨下个不停，气温变得非常冷
        经过这么多年晴天，Harrison 震惊了，他的举动好像他从来没有在英国生活过。
        直到最后，他终于无法忍受，他卖掉了房子离开了这个国家。他梦想了这么多年的事情破灭了，直到最后，Harrison考虑了每一件事情除了天气。
