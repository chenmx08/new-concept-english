# Do you speak English 

------

I had an  amusing experience last year 。 After I had left  a small village in the south of France 。 I drove on to the next town 。 On the way ， a young man waved to me。 I  stopped and  he asked me for a lift ，

As soon as he had got into the car ， I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language。 Apart  from a few words， I  do not know any French at all。Neither of us spoke during the journey ， I had nearly reached the town ， when the young man suddenly said ， very slowly， ‘Do you speak English， As I soon learnt ， he was English himself ‘

        去年，我有一段非常有趣的经历。当时我正开车从法国南部的一个小镇前往另一个小镇。途中路边有个年轻男人向我招手。我停下车，他向我询问是否可以搭便车。他一上车，我用法语向他问好，他也同样用法语回复我。寒暄片刻后，我已经不会说其他法语了。之后的旅途中，我们两个人都沉默不语。当快要到达小镇的时候，那个年轻人突然开口 非常慢的语速说道，’你会说英语吗，‘我马上意识到原来他是英国人’
