# Through the forest 

------

Mrs Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran through a forest after two men 

They had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag 

In the struggle ,the strap broken and , with the bag in their possession ,both men started running through the trees 

Mrs Sterling got so angry that she ran after them ,

She was soon out of breath ,but she continued to run 

When she caught up with them ,she saw that they had sat down and were going through the contents of the bag ,so she ran straight at them .

The men got such a fright that they dropped the bag and ran away ,'The strap needs mending ',said Mrs Sterling later ,'but they did not steal anything '

       Anne Sterling 没有考虑到追赶两个男人穿过树林需要承担的风险。当时她正在树林旁边和孩子们野餐，两个男人冲了过来并且试图抢走她的包。在争抢中，手提包的带子断了，他们抢走了包，跑进了树林当中
        Sterling太太非常生气，然后追着他们进入了树林。她很快就上气不接下气，但是她依然坚持追着他们。
        当她追到他们的时候，她看到那两个人正坐着翻她的包，因此她直接向他么走过去。
        他们吓了一跳，直接扔掉包跑路了。包的带子需要修理一下，Sterling如此说道，还好他们什么都没有偷走
