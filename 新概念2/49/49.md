# The end of a dream 

------

tired of sleep on the floor , a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed .

For the first time in his life ,he become the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress 

Because the weather was very hot ,he carried the bed on to the roof of his house .

He slept very well for the first tow nights, but on the third night ,a storm blew up .

A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard below .

The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground .

Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt .

When he woke up , he was still on the mattress ,Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him ,the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house .

After he had put it on the floor ,he promptly went to sleep again .
