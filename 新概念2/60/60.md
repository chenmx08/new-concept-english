# The future 

------

At a village fair , I decided to visit a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky .

I went into her tent and she told me to site down 

After I had given her some money ,she looked into a crystal ball and said :'A relation of yours is coming to see you 'She will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days .

The moment you leave this tent , you will get a big surprise . 

A woman you know well will rush towards you .

She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place ,That is all 

As soon as I went outside , I forget all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me ,'where have you been hiding ?' she asked impatiently ,'your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station to meet her 'We are late already , As she walked away , I followed her out of the fair .

Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper , the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased 

The tree was planted near the church fifty  years ago ,but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation .

It is said that if anyone touches the tree ,he will have bad luck ; if he picks a leaf , he will die 

Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims 

The vicar has been asked to have the  tree cut down ,but so far he has refused .

He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income ,as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it .

In spite of all that has been said , the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk .

So far , not one of them has been struck down by sudden death

       在乡村集市上，我打算去拜访一位被称为未来预见者Madam Bellinsky。我走进她的帐篷，她让我坐下来。在我付给他钱之后，她看向水晶球并且说道，你的一段关系正在找你，她会在今天晚上达到，并且停留几天。
        你现在离开帐篷，有一个大惊喜在等着你，一个你认识的女人正在跑向你。她会跟你讲话然后把你带离这个地方。这就是全部了。
        我一到帐篷外面就忘记了她刚才告诉我的话，因为我老婆跑过来找我说道，你躲到哪里去了，她着急的说道，你的妹妹不到一小时就到了，我们必须去车站接她，我们现在出发已经迟了，跟随这她离开的脚步，我也离开了集市
