# A blessing in disguise 

------

The tiny village  of Frinley is said to possess a 'cursed tree '

Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper , the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased 

The tree was planted near the church fifty  years ago ,but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation .

It is said that if anyone touches the tree ,he will have bad luck ; if he picks a leaf , he will die 

Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims 

The vicar has been asked to have the  tree cut down ,but so far he has refused .

He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income ,as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it .

In spite of all that has been said , the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk .

So far , not one of them has been struck down by sudden death

       一个小村庄Frinley里面据说有一棵厄运树。由于树的故事被报纸报道，来Frinley小镇的游客越来越多了。这棵树被种在教堂旁边大约50年了，直到最近才有了这个邪恶的传说。据说是这样的任何触摸这棵树的人都会变得不幸，如果他带走树叶那么他就会死。
