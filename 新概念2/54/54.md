# Sticky fingers 

------

After breakfast ,I sent the children to school and then I went to the shops 

It was still early when I returned home .

The children were at school ,my husband was at work and the house was quiet 

So I decided to make some meat pies 

In a short time I was mixing butter and flour and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry .

At exactly that moment ,the telephone rang . 

Nothing could have been more annoying . I picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers and was dismayed when I recognized the voice of Helen Bates .

It took me ten minutes to persuade her to ring back later .

At last I hung up the receiver .What a mess ! 

There was pastry on my fingers ,on the telephone ,and on the doorknobs. I had no sooner got back to the kitchen than the doorbell rang loud enough to wake the dead .

This time it was the postman and he wanted me to sign for a registered letter

        早餐后，我把孩子送到了学校然后去了趟超市。当我回到家的时候还很早。孩子还在学校，我的丈夫还在上班，家里很安静。所以我决定做一些肉派。
        很快我就把黄油和面粉混合一起，我的手马上就变得黏糊糊的了。就在此时，电话响了起来，没有什么东西比这更加烦人的了。我用两个黏糊糊的手机夹起听筒听到了Helen Bates的声音
        我花了十分钟才说服她让他晚点再打过来。我挂了电话意识到现在简直一团糟。
        面粉糊糊挂在我的手指上，电话上还有门把手上。等到我刚回到厨房，该死的门铃声就响了起来。
        这次是一个邮差，他想要我签收一封挂号信
