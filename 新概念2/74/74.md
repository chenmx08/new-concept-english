# out of the limelight

------

an ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off。

Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes， they had taken special precautions so that no  one should recognize them。

But as they soon discovered ， disguises can sometimes be too perfect。

​	this is a wonderful place for a picnic ， said Gloria Gleam

​	It couldn't be better， Gloria， Brinksley Meers agreed ， No newspaper men， no film fans ！ Why don't we come more often？

​	Meanwhile ， two other actors ，Rock wall Slinger and Merlin Greeves ,had carried two large food baskets to a shady spot under some trees. When they had all made themselves comfortable, a stranger appeared . He looked very angry . 'Now you get out of here, all of you ' he shouted, 'I'm sheriff here . Do you  see that  notice ? It  says No camping ---- in case you can't read 

​	Look , sheriff , said Rockwall , don't be too hard on us , I'm Rockwall Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves 

​	Oh , is it? said the sheriff with a sneer, Well , I'm Brinksley Meers, and my other name is Gloria Gleam

Now you get out of here fast 

Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper , the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased 

The tree was planted near the church fifty  years ago ,but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation .

It is said that if anyone touches the tree ,he will have bad luck ; if he picks a leaf , he will die 

Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims 

The vicar has been asked to have the  tree cut down ,but so far he has refused .

He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income ,as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it .

In spite of all that has been said , the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk .

So far , not one of them has been struck down by sudden death

       在一条干涸的河床边有个古老的汽车站台，一个著名乐队组合成员在这里下车。他们戴着黑色墨镜，穿着旧衣服。他们穿的特别平常以至于没有人认出他们。他们很快发现，这个时间刚刚好。
        这地方用来野餐蹦野迪简直完美，Gloria Gleam 说道
        没有比这更好的地方了，Gloria， Brinksley Meers 同意到，没有记者，没有粉丝，我们可以经常到这里来
        同时，有两个其他演员Rockwall Slinger 和 Merlin Greeves 来到这里，他们带着两大包食物坐在树下野餐。当他们正舒适的坐在树下时，一位陌生人出现了，他看起来十分愤怒，你们现在马上离开这里，他大喊道，这是我sheriff 的领地，你看到那个牌子了吗，禁止野餐，你们是不是不识字
        别激动，sheriff，Rockwall 说道，别对我们这么凶，我是 Rockwall Slinger而这位是 Merlin Greeves。
        哦，真的吗？sheriff 疑惑道，好吧，我是 Brinksley Meers，我另一个名字是 Gloria Gleam，现在你应该赶快离开这里
