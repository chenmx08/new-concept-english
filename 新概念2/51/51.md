# Reward  for virtue 

------

My  friend ,Hugh ,has always been fat , but things got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet .

He began his diet a week ago .First of all ,he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden .

The list included most of the things Hugh loves ,butter ,potatoes ,rice ,beer ,milk ,chocolate ,and sweets .

Yesterday I paid him a visit ,I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as ever .

He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk ,

It was obvious that he was very embarrassed .

When I asked him what he was doing ,he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk .

He explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself occasionally .

Then he showed me the contents of the parcel . It contained five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets

         我的朋友Hugn 长得很胖，越来越胖的他决定节食减肥。他一周前开始他的节食减肥计划，首先，他列了张表上面都是他决定不吃的食物但又喜欢吃的食物，例如，黄油，土豆，米饭，啤酒，牛奶，巧克力，糖。
        昨天我去拜访他，敲响门铃，当我看到他还是和以前一样胖的时候一点也不意外。他带我进入房间，匆忙将一个大袋子藏到桌子下面。很明显他看起来有点尴尬，我问他刚刚藏了什么，他有点内疚的笑笑把带子放回桌子上面，并且解释说道，他的节食减肥计划太严格了，所以偶尔需要奖励一下自己。
        接着他把袋子里面的东西给我看，里面有五个大巧克力和三包糖
