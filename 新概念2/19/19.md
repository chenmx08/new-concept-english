# Sold  out 

------

The  play may begin at any moment , I said 

It may have begun already , Susan answered 

I hurried to the ticket office , May I have two tickets please i asked 

I'm sorry , we have sold out ' the girl said 

What a pity , Susan exclaimed 

Just then , a man hurried to the ticket office 

Can I return these two tickets , he asked 

Certainly , the girl said 

i went back to the ticket office at once 

Could I have those two tickets please , I asked 

Certainly , the girl said , but they're for next Wednesday 's performance , Do you still want them 

I might as well have them , I said sadly

		表演随时都可能开始，我说道
    	它可能已经开始了，Susan 回复到
        我跑到售票处询问到，我想买两张票
        抱歉，票已经卖完了，女孩回复到
        真可惜，Susan说道
        就在此刻，一个人急忙跑到售票处，
        我能退这两张票吗，他问
        当然，女孩回复到
        我马上返回到售票处，
        我能买这两张票吗，我问道
        当然，女孩回复说，但是这两张是下周三的票，你还想要买这两张票吗
        我最好还是买了把，我伤心的回答道
